Overview:
This Python project generates random sentences based on a user-defined context-free grammar. Users define grammar rules with non-terminals and their associated productions. The program then traverses the grammar's production rules to generate sentences by randomly selecting productions.
Features:
- Supports user-defined context-free grammar rules.
- Randomly generates sentences based on the defined grammar.
- Handles both terminal and non-terminal symbols.
How to Use:
- Run the script in a Python environment.
- Input the number of non-terminals and their corresponding productions.
- Specify the number of sentences to generate.
- The program outputs randomly generated sentences.
